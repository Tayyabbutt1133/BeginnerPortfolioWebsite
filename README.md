# A beginner portfolio website design using HTML and CSS is a clean and visually appealing web page that showcases your work and skills. It typically features a simple navigation menu at the top, highlighting sections like "Home," "About Me," and "Portfolio." The homepage may include a welcoming header with your name and a brief introduction. The portfolio section displays your projects with thumbnail images and brief descriptions, which can be clicked to view more details. The design maintains a consistent color scheme and typography for a professional and cohesive look, making it easy for visitors to explore your work and learn more about you.
